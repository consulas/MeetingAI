## Trivia
Conversations focus on definitions, technical explanations, or conceptual comparisons. They typically contain factual queries using phrases like "what is", "explain", or "compare".
### Trivia Examples
1. What are the 4 pillars of OOP?
2. Tell me about the differences between next.js and react router.
3. What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?
4. Explain the concept of inheritance in programming.
5. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
6. When would you use Kafka over RabbitMQ?
7. What is the difference between data science and machine learning?
8. Explain the CI/CD pipeline in DevOps.
9. What is the difference between unit testing and integration testing?
10. What is the role of QA in software development?
11. What is the purpose of a container in DevOps? 
12. How are containers used in Kubernetes?

## Resume
Discussions center around past experiences, challenges, projects, or teamwork scenarios. They often include phrases like "tell me about a time", "describe an experience", or "how did you handle".
### Resume Examples
1. Tell me about a time where you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.
2. Describe a challenging backend problem you've solved.
3. How do you handle tight deadlines?
4. Can you describe a project where you had to learn a new technology?
5. Tell me about a time when you had to mentor someone.
6. Describe a time when you had to debug a complex issue.
7. Tell me about your project in your last company. What technologies did you use? What roadblocks did you run into and how did you solve them?
8. Can you describe a time when you had to optimize a slow system?
9. Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult team member.
10. Describe a project where you had to integrate multiple systems.

## Coding
Conversations involve problem-solving with algorithms or code implementation. They typically mention specific programming languages, contain technical constraints, or request optimization approaches.
### Coding Examples
1. Implement a binary search algorithm.
2. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
3. Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.
4. Implement a function to find the longest common prefix in an array of strings.
5. Write a function to reverse a linked list.
6. Debug this function.
7. Refactor this frontend code into multiple components.
8. Implement a quicksort algorithm.
9. Write a function to find the shortest path in a graph.
10. Implement a function to check if a number is prime.

## System Design
Discussions focus on architectural components, scalability, or distributed systems. They frequently mention tradeoffs, system requirements, or large-scale considerations.
### System Design Examples
1. Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly.
2. Create an online timecard system for amazon warehouse employees.
3. Develop a chat application.
4. Build a ride-sharing service.
5. Construct an e-commerce platform.
6. Implement a recommendation system.
7. Develop a search engine.
8. Create a social media platform.
9. Design a database schema for a library management system.
10. Design classes for a banking system.

## Clarify
This category is rare. Prioritize selecting system design and coding categories first. These questions request deeper analysis, constraints, or tradeoffs before solving. 
### Clarify Examples
1. Generate a list of clarifying questions for this system design.
2. Analyze these clarifications with respect to the system you're designing.
3. What are the potential scalability issues with this design?
4. What are the potential security concerns with this design?
5. What are the potential performance bottlenecks with this design?
